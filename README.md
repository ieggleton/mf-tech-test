# Top Three Words Parser

## Running
The functionality has been built as static Utils function(s)
no library has been built or anything convoluted. 

## Functionality
There is a large implementation using streams for large input
as well as a simple string implementation.

Everything is in the one class file with a small supporting
object for storing the count against the word.

## Testing
There are a set of tests, mainly matching the examples given in
the spec. There use JUnit 5/AssertJ and have been worded in Given/When/Then
format.

Sorry for the non standard libraries when testing!
